      <!-- ===================== HOME PAGE CONTENT ===================== -->
      <h3>Home page</h3>

      <p><strong>Welcome / First Impression</strong></p>
      <p>
        Wilson Wealth Management is a personal wealth management firm focused on
        disciplined portfolio management and simple, understandable planning.
        The home page will quickly communicate what the firm does, who it serves,
        and how visitors can take action. Many people feel overwhelmed by investing
        because there is too much noise online, so this website will keep the message
        clear: long-term strategy, diversification, consistent reviews, and decisions
        based on goals rather than hype.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Why People Will Visit</strong></p>
      <p>
        People will come to this site because they want help managing investments or
        they want clarity about what “portfolio management” actually includes. Visitors
        may be comparing options and looking for a professional presence that shows
        the advisor’s process, values, and communication style. A visitor should be able
        to answer: What does Wilson Wealth Management do? What is the approach to risk?
        What services are offered? And how do I contact Hayden Wilson to start a
        conversation?
      </p>

      <p><strong>What Makes This Site Different</strong></p>
      <p>
        Instead of confusing jargon, the home page will use simple explanations and a
        friendly tone. It will describe what the client experience feels like and what
        happens after a consultation: discovery, a clear plan, implementation, and
        ongoing review. The site will also include a disclaimer and transparent language
        that avoids guarantees. The goal is trust. Visitors should feel they are reading
        something that was written for real people, not just marketing.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Call to Action</strong></p>
      <p>
        The main action visitors will take is contacting the firm. The home page will
        include a clear button such as “Request a Consultation” and a short section that
        explains what information to bring: goals, timeline, existing accounts, and
        questions about risk and fees. This helps visitors feel prepared and increases
        the likelihood that they reach out.

      <!-- ===================== SERVICES PAGE CONTENT ===================== -->
      <h3>Services</h3>

      <p><strong>Portfolio Management</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Services page will explain portfolio management in practical terms. This
        includes building an investment strategy, selecting an appropriate mix of assets,
        and keeping the portfolio aligned to the client’s goals through monitoring and
        rebalancing. Visitors will learn that portfolio management is not about predicting
        the market. It is about making consistent decisions over time, controlling risk,
        and staying focused on long-term outcomes.
      </p>

      <p><strong>One-Time Portfolio Review</strong></p>
      <p>
        Some visitors will not want ongoing management right away. For them, the site will
        offer a one-time portfolio review. This section will describe a “second opinion”
        service that can help identify concentration risk, unnecessary complexity, and
        potential fee issues. The output of the review will be a clear summary of what is
        working, what could be improved, and what changes could better match the client’s
        timeline and comfort level.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Planning and Ongoing Support</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Services page will also describe planning support, such as aligning investments
        to retirement goals and other milestones. Visitors will see that the planning
        process is designed to keep decisions organized and calm, especially during
        volatile markets. This page will include a short FAQ section answering common
        questions like “How often do we review?” and “What happens if my goals change?”
      </p>

        Many clients feel stress when markets change. This page will explain that the
        firm’s role is to guide decisions based on the plan, avoid emotional reactions,
        and keep communication honest.
      </p>

      <p><strong>The Client Process</strong></p>
      <p>
        The About page will include a simple step-by-step process so visitors know what
        to expect. Example steps include: a first conversation, gathering information,
        discussing goals and risk, building a strategy, implementing changes, and setting

        professional, repeatable method for working with clients.
